    Bubble sort 
        -   each pair of adjacent elements is compared and swapped if they are not in order
        -   first (0,1) then (1,2) then (2,3) then (3,4) then (4,5) 
        -   arr[0] > arr[1] SWAP else do nothing ie (arr[j] < arr[j+1])
        -   after one iteration largest elemenet bubbles up last position
        -   at each iteration one element is in its correct position
        -   after 2 iteration 2 element will be in its correct position
        -   FOR N ITERATION WE NEED N - 1 ITERATION
        
           
        
      Selection Sort
        -   array divide into 2 sub array one sorted and another is unsorted
        -   find min from unsorted array and swap with start of unsorted array 
        -   FOR N ITERATION WE NEED N - 1 ITERATION
        -
