-   Dijkstras algorithm 
    -   Find shortest path from node i to all nodes 

-   Prims is MST (minimun spanning tree) 
        -   Genrate minimum spannig tree
        -   Implmentation is same as Dijkstras

Graph Topics
        1. Shortest path
            -   Dijkestra's 
            -   Bellman fords (can work onn egative edges)
        
        2. Minimum spanning tree 
            -   Prims (implmentation same as Dijkestra)
            -   Kruskals DCDS - generate forest and can work on disconected component

        3. Cycle detection
            -   Floyd cycle detection algorithm
            -   Brents algorithm
    
        4. Strongly connected components
            -   Kosarajus algorithm
            -   Tarjans strongly connected components algorithm
